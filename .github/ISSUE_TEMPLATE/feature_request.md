# Feature Request Instructions

> This template contains an example (fictitious) feature request. Please replace all text except for the section headers (they start with \##) to describe your suggestion.
> Applying labels to your feature request is helpful, but not necessary - the moderation team will review and apply labels as needed.

> Thank you for your contribution to improving LOGistICAL!

## Summary

> Please provide a short description of your feature request here. E.g.:

It would be nice if there was an Autopilot that had the trucks deliver cargos to nearby businesses automatically.

## Use case

> Who would be the primary consumers of this feature? E.g.:

Players who have a hard time keeping up with the vast number of places to deliver cargo to.

## Detailed Description

> Describe an example of how you see this feature being used. E.g.:

Players would select a truck, send it to the location of an industry (or industries) and then turn on the AI through a button on the truck's dashboard. 
The truck would then select an available cargo from that industry, and begin delivering the goods to nearby businesses that can accept it.
In Zen Mode, they could also deliver to Towns, but in regular mode they would avoid towns due to consumption.

When the industry is exhausted, and/or there are no destinations within a certain (configurable?) radius, the AI turns off.
