# Bug Reporting Instructions

> This template contains an example (fictitious) bug report, to help demonstrate with what a bug report could look like.
> Please replace all text except for the section headers (with start with `##`) to describe the bug you encountered.
> Applying labels to your bug report is helpful, but not necessary if you don't feel comfortable with it. The moderation team will review and apply labels as needed.

> Thank you for taking the time to report this, and helping to improve LOGistICAL!

## Summary

> In this space please provide a short description of the bug you've encountered. E.g.:

Game crashes when painting a vehicle hot pink.

## Game Version

> Please provide the version of the game that this occurred on. The version is displayed at the launch screen, and at the bottom of the Settings window after you have loaded a save. E.g.:

Version: LOGistICAL Earth, 846f

## Reproduction Steps

> Please provide, to the best of your ability, steps to reproduce the issue. (This helps the developer confirm the bug, determine where in the code the issue lies, and confirm that he has fixed it)

> For a bulleted list, add a * at the beginning of each line. E.g.:

* Multi-select at least two vehicles.
* Click the Paint Palette icon to enter Paint mode
* Click on a vehicle other than the ones you multi-selected, to cycle paint colors.
* When cycling to the next color would make the truck hot pink, the game crashes.

## Expected Behaviour (optional)

> If you feel that it will help explain the bug better, then you can use this section to describe what you expected to have happen after following the reproduction steps you provided. E.g.:

Expected the truck to be painted hot pink, and no game crash.
