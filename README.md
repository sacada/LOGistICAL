## LOGistICAL

Welcome! This github repository serves as a consolidated place for reporting bugs and requesting new features for the video game series "LOGistICAL".

The latest installation in the series is LOGistICAL: Earth and, like the rest of the LOGistICAL franchise, was written by sacada and is [available on Steam.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/672150/LOGistICAL_3_Earth/)

The entire LOGistICAL franchise is supported by an active and very friendly Discord community. All players are welcome! <a href="https://discord.gg/xytyWUA"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join-7289DA.svg?logo=discord&longCache=true&style=flat" /></a>

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests:

Visit the [Issues](https://github.com/sacada/LOGistICAL/issues) tab to browse through all of the reported bugs and suggested new features.

Feel free to comment on any issue! For example, if you have more information that can help reproduce (or work around) a bug, then go ahead and comment on that bug to add the information, we really appreciate it! The same goes for ideas that expand upon somebody's Feature Request that would make it even more awesome!

However, we do ask that comments always be civil, constructive, and add meaningful information. If you merely want to express support (or dislike) for a feature request, or indicate that you have encountered a bug as well, then use the "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" emoticons on that issue.

Thank you, for your contributions to making LOGistICAL an even better game series!
